# GENERAL INFORMATION

This README file was generated on [2021-10-07] by [Authors].

This project is developed by the Latin American Bike Knowledge Sharing (LABIKS) with peer, after analyzing data from all in operation systems along the region. As a result of these analysis, we develop an annual report called "Bike Sharing Systems in Latin America" and we maintain an online map called "The Latin America Bike-sharing Map", which provides information from these BSS's.

Our intention is to increase the knowledge about this theme, and we aim to disseminate the acquired information and data to stimulate new ideas and new developments.

This repository contains all data bases used in the reports over the release year.
